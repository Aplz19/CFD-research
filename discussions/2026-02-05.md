# Discussion - February 5, 2026

## Session Summary
Initial setup conversation. Established file structure and workflow for CFD research work.

## Key Points
- Created documentation system for maintaining context across sessions
- File structure: purpose.md, progress/ folder with module summaries, daily discussion notes
- Working on Module A1: FV methods for 1D advection equation
- Planning 30min/day minimum work sessions
- Future research direction: laminar-turbulent transition modeling

## Module Summaries Added
- Read both module PDFs and created detailed summaries
- Module 0: SSPRK time integrators, grid I/O, geometry preprocessing
- Module A1: 1st-order FV for 1D linear advection with LLF flux

## Next Steps
- Implement rhs_advection_1d function for Module A1
- Run test cases (smooth sine wave, discontinuous top-hat)
- Generate error tables and plots for report
